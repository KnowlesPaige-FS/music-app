# EleutherosVibe

Welcome to EleutherosVibe, a dynamic music streaming platform where freedom in musical expression and discovery takes center stage. Our app allows users to explore a vast library of music, create playlists, and enjoy high-quality audio streaming.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: Our client-side is built using React, a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React helps us maintain a fast, scalable, and simple frontend, enhancing user experience.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: As our runtime environment.
- **Express**: This is the backbone of our server, handling routes and requests with ease. Itâ€™s minimal, scalable, and flexible.
- **Nodemon**: Used in development for automatically restarting the server whenever code changes are detected. This makes development smoother and faster.
